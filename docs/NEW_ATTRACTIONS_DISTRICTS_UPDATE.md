### 3. Updated District Metadata (`constants/DistrictMetadata.ts`)

### 5. Updated Districts Data (`data/districts.json`)
All 16 districts now have complete metadata matching the constants.

## Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing attractions remain unchanged
- Service layer automatically handles new data
- No breaking changes to API or component interfaces
- Type system properly validates all new entries

## Testing

Run the app to verify:
1. All districts appear in the district picker
2. New attractions load correctly
3. Distance calculations work for all new locations
4. Manual district selection includes all 16 districts
5. Attraction filtering by category includes new categories

## Districts as Attractions

For districts without specific attractions (Galata, Nişantaşı, Moda), the app now automatically creates synthetic district attractions. This ensures users always see something interesting in every district rather than an empty state.

### How It Works:
1. The `attractionService` identifies districts without attractions
2. Creates a synthetic attraction using district metadata
3. Uses the district's center coordinates
4. Displays district description and key landmarks
5. Assigns appropriate images for each district

This approach provides a better user experience by:
- Eliminating "No attractions found" messages
- Showcasing the district itself as a destination
- Providing useful information about the area
- Maintaining consistent UI across all districts

## No Additional Changes Required

The following components automatically support the new data:
- `attractionService.ts` - Dynamically loads all attractions and creates district attractions
- `distanceService.ts` - Calculates distances for any coordinates
- `AttractionList.tsx` - Displays all attractions
- `AttractionCard.tsx` - Renders any attraction
- `DistrictPicker.tsx` - Shows all districts
- `explore.tsx` - Filters and displays all data

The app architecture was designed to be data-driven, so adding new attractions and districts only requires updating the JSON files and type definitions.
